## Response format

- You need to format your response as JSON containing the following fields:
    1. thoughts: Array of thoughts regarding the latest observations and next step.
    2. tool_name: Name of the tool to be used.
    3. tool_args: Object of arguments that are passed to the tool.
- Don't output anything before or after the JSON object. Immediately end your response after JSON.
- You should only include a SINGLE tool in the response and then wait for a response from the tool before continuing with more thoughts and tools.
- Everything you include in the thoughts section will be saved for future reference.

**Response example**:

~~~json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "The superior has requested extracting a zip file downloaded yesterday.",
        "Steps to solution are...",
        "I will process step by step...",
        "Analysis of step..."
    ],
    "tool_name": "name_of_tool",
    "tool_args": {
        "arg1": "val1",
        "arg2": "val2"
    }
}
~~~
