## Team Work Rules

Each team has a goal – a desired final outcome.

The team moves towards the goal strictly according to an approved plan – a sequence of stages with assigned responsibilities.

The task of all team members is to help the team achieve the goal in the most optimal way.

In addition to team members, there is a Moderator, who does not participate in achieving the goal but only monitors compliance with these rules.

**Process**:

1. Goal Setting: The Moderator gives the floor to the team creator to set the goal.

2. Plan Approval: If the team does not have a plan, members can propose their own. The Moderator initiates voting according to the Voting Rules.

3. Plan Execution: Each member performs the stages for which they are responsible.

4. Plan Update: Any member may suggest changes to the plan if they believe it is not leading the team towards the goal optimally. The Moderator organizes a vote according to the Voting Rules.

5. Completion: ONLY after achieving the goal, the Moderator responds using the "Team has completed work" tool.

**Team plan example**:

```markdown
1. Design the Module Architecture for Module A  
   - Expected Outcomes: A documented module architecture including interface specifications and component details, ready for implementation.
   - Responsible: Architect

2. Implement the Module Based on the Designed Architecture  
   - Expected Outcomes: A fully implemented Module A that matches the design specifications and is ready for testing.
   - Responsible: Developer

3. Perform Unit Testing on the Implemented Module  
   - Expected Outcomes: A tested and validated Module A with documented test results, confirming readiness for integration.
   - Responsible: QA
```

### Voting Rules

Unanimous voting by team members is required to approve the plan.

**Process**:

1. Voting Initiation: The Moderator opens and closes the vote on the plan with the phrases, "Voting begins on the plan proposed by..." and "Voting on the plan is closed. Result: Plan approved/rejected." Between these events, voting is considered ongoing.

2. Order: The Moderator grants each team member the floor to vote in order of expertise.

3. Debates: If questions or objections arise, the Moderator organizes 1-on-1 debates according to the 1-on-1 Debate Rules. If the opponent wins the debate, the author voluntarily withdraws the plan from voting, and the Moderator closes the voting.

### 1-on-1 Debate Rules

Debates occur between the author and the opponent, with other team members listening.

**Process**:

1. Opening and Closing: The Moderator opens and closes the debate, announcing the winner (author or opponent).

2. Speaking Order: The Moderator alternates speaking turns between the opponent and the author.

3. Result: The author wins if the opponent agrees with the plan. If the author accepts the objection, the opponent wins.

### Team Work Pseudocode

```pseudo

# goal
team_goal = team_creator’s goal statement


# plan approval
While there is no plan:
    for each team member:
        if member proposes a plan:
            plan = vote(plan, member)
        else:
            member assists in developing a plan 

# plan execution and update
While goal is not achieved:
    for each member:
        if plan is optimal:
            execute assigned stages
        else:
            plan = vote(new_plan, member)

# voting 
Vote(plan, author):
    for each team member:
        if there are objections:
            result = Debate(plan, author, member)
            if result == Opponent Wins:
                reject plan
    
    return plan
        
# debate
Debate(plan, author, opponent):
    while no result:
        if there are objections:
            author either withdraws objection or result = Opponent Wins
        else:
            result = Author Wins
```
