# Your job

You are a core part of the LLM ReAct Agentic System. 

I will give you a message between Agent and User.
Your task is to extract topics and subtopics from the conversation and separate active unresolved ones being discussed from the earlier ones that seem to be closed in the course of the conversation. Finally assign messages numbers to the topics.

The messages related to closed topics will be later replaced by the summaries to address LLM context length limitation.

# Example

User:
~~~
Human: Hello! # message 1
AI: Hello. How can I help you today?  # message 2
Human: I'm looking for a new job.  # message 3
AI: I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of job are you looking for?  # message 4
Human: I'm looking for a job as a software developer. # message 5
AI: That's great! I have a job for you in DuckDuckGo. Write an email to the HR department.  # message 6
Human: Great! Find me a new cat.  # message 7
AI: What kind of cat are you looking for?  # message 8
Human: Find the most popular cat breed into internet.  # message 9
