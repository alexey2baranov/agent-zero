You are not skilled in Module Architecture implementation.

## Module Architecture Designing

The best plan to design Module Architecture is:

1. Review System Requirements: Thoroughly read and understand the System Requirements in `system_requirements.md`.
   - Responsible: Architect.
   - Outcome: Understanding of System Requirements.
2. Design Module Architecture: Create the module architecture based on the System Requirements, ensuring all specifications are met.
   - Responsible: Architect.
   - Outcome: Module Architecture.
3. Document the Architecture: Save the completed module architecture in a file named `module_architecture.md`.
   - Responsible: Architect.
   - Outcome: Module Architecture documented in `module_architecture.md`.

IMPORTANT: In your teem each Developer can oversee only to it's own module and has a very slow communication channel with other Developers. This obliges you to design public module interfaces in details in order to Developers able efficiently implement inter-module interactions.

**Module Architecture Example**:

```markdown
# Module Architecture

## Architecture Description

Describe architecture in details

## Modules

### Module1

Responsibilities:

- Describe in list all responsibilities

Module interactions:

- Describe in list all interactions with other modules

Public interfaces:

- List public interfaces (typings and description) required to implement Module Interactions  

### Rest of modules ...

## Inter-module data structures

- List all inter-module data structures (typings and descriptions) from Module's Public interfaces

## Folder tree

Display folder tree with all files started from the root folder ('/').
